This is an educational project because its funny and a good replacement for the official final project of our school. The code is crude, ugly and evil. It will be fixedâ„¢. 

#To try (which you shouldnt)
clone the repo, install glfw and vulkan dependencies:
```
sudo apt install vulkan-tools libglfw3-dev libvulkan-dev spirv-tools libglm-dev
```
get yourself a shader compiler preferably glslc (https://github.com/google/shaderc/blob/main/downloads.md)
